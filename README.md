- A hero section with a heading, a subheading, and a background image (images can be premade)
- An About section with a brief paragraph about yourself and an image and by using JavaScript, allow users to expand and collapse the paragraph on the About section
    - Application of CSS grid or flexbox to achieve a visually pleasing layout for this section
- A Contact section with a form that includes fields for name, email, and message
    - Application of advanced CSS styling techniques to create an attractive form design.

## DYNAMIC CONTENT GENERATION
Implementation of dynamic content rendering using the Liquid templating engine:
- Create a JSON or YAML file that contains an array of objects, each representing a project you've worked on in the past
- Use Liquid to dynamically generate a "Projects" section on your webpage and iterate through the array of project objects and display each project's information, including its name, description, and an image
- Add a link or button to each project that leads to its corresponding GitHub repository
- Use Liquid filters to truncate long project descriptions and ensure they fit neatly within the layout
